Project Objectives
Assess how efficiently the body expends energy
Compare actual calorie expenditure with calorie expenditure calculated using the MET formula
Analyze seasonality, cyclic patterns, and behavioral trends
Data Preparation & Segmentation
I prepared the dataset and performed the segmentation manually without evaluating the elbow method or silhouette score.
Segmentation included:
Sedentary users
Active users
Athletes
Interpretation of Regression Results
When interpreting the contribution of individual factors to calorie expenditure, the features StepTotal, TotalIntensity, and METs showed strong multicollinearity (high correlation with each other).
The linear regression model demonstrated a solid overall explanatory power (R² ≈ 0.80).
However, the relative weights of the coefficients indicate the priority order of factors driving calorie burn — not precise numerical magnitudes.
Energy Efficiency & ROI Analysis
Analysis of energy efficiency and return on intensity across user clusters revealed:
More trained users cover longer distances per minute of activity and per calorie burned.
Their movement is more economical and consistent.
Time-series models (SARIMA, Prophet) additionally showed:
Clear cyclic patterns in activity
Predictable weekly and hourly rhythms
Forecastable fluctuations in efficiency metrics
Conclusions
Training level directly correlates with both the total volume of activity and the efficiency with which it is performed.
Intensity is the primary driver of calorie expenditure.
MET-minutes is a reliable and stable metric for estimating real physical load.
Time-series forecasting confirms that users follow repeatable cycles, which can be predicted.
⚠️ Important Note
By removing zero values, I shift the results toward higher activity levels.
Therefore, the obtained results should be interpreted only as a methodological demonstration, given the limitations of the source data.
